			<h3>Statue of Liberty (New York)</h3>

			<p>Once in America, people tend to see all the sights of the United States. One of the most famous symbols of the country in the world - the Statue of Liberty - is located on a small island in the port of New York.<p>

The majestic sculpture of a woman with a torch in her hand, outstretched into the sky, became the personification of American freedom. The crown on her head has seven rays, which means seven continents and seven oceans (in Western geographic tradition). In her other hand, she holds a plate with the date of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence engraved on it.
<p>
The monument was made by French craftsmen by order of the US government and transported to the island in parts. Here the Americans have already collected it on the built base. The Statue of Liberty is not only a symbol, but also an active lighthouse in New York Harbor. The height of the statue from the beginning of the pedestal to the top of the torch is 93 meters. The figure is made of copper plates mounted on a steel frame.
<p>
If you are wondering what to see in the US, be sure to visit the Statue of Liberty. Inside it is equipped with the Museum of American Settlement, which displays the historical path of the country, as well as a spiral staircase leading to the very top, from where you can view the entire harbor. Tourists are brought to the island by ferry, which is very convenient.</p>

			<p>Sights of the United States are of great interest to tourists. A special place among them is occupied by New York's Central Park. It is an oasis of tranquility in Manhattan's busy business. The green area is 4 km long and 800 meters wide.
<p>
The park was opened in 1859. Tens of thousands of workers improved the territory for another 20 years. About 5 million trees were planted, and the land was brought from ecologically clean areas.
<p>
Now the park has a whole recreation infrastructure. These are various playgrounds, attractions, ice rinks and just picnic lawns. In the park there are:
<ul>
	<li>Central Zoo, divided into zones for children and adults;</li>
	<li>Dairi - here you can find all the information related to the activities of the park;</li>
	<li>Gapstow Bridge - a stone bridge, a meeting place for couples in love;</li>
	<li>Sheep meadow - a huge clearing where you can sit right on the grass;</li>
	<li>Belvedere - an ancient castle over the Turtle Pond;</li>
	<li>Shakespeare's Garden - a 4-acre site where plants celebrated by the great playwright are planted;</li>
	<li>Cleopatra's Needle is a 20-meter-high statue donated by Egypt in 1880 in exchange for help in modernizing the country.</li>
</ul>
These are the largest elements of the vast forest area. Now you will not have a question of what to see in the US first. Central Park is the most visited attraction - 25 million people a year.</p>

			<h3>Chinatown (New York, Manhattan)</h3>
			<a href="https://www.centralparknyc.org/" target="_blank"><img src="http://cdn.tripzaza.com/ru/destinations/files/2017/03/USA-3-China-Town-e1490930873822.jpg" height="367"></a>
			<p>A miracle has happened - you are in New York and have already seen the main sights of the United States, highly recommended by guidebooks: the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. Now is the time to head to Manhattan's Chinatown to feel that the world's main intersection is not only skyscrapers, frantic traffic and cash flows.
<p>
In Chinatown, a popular habitat for the Chinese diaspora, a stone's throw from the fashionable areas of the Big Apple, time slows down. Ethnic flavor shines through in this place in everything: traditional elements of the architecture of the Middle Kingdom, red lanterns, signs written in hieroglyphs, noisy crowds of immigrants from China, Vietnam and other Far Eastern countries.
<p>
Grand Street and Canal Street attract tourists and locals alike with numerous bars and restaurants for authentic Chinese cuisine. There are also concentrated shops and street clumps of immigrants from Asia, selling souvenirs, fakes of famous high fashion brands and real Chinese products like fish candies, spices, bean noodles. The street fish market is generally a separate attraction; they sell live snakes, turtles, frogs along with the usual shrimp, shellfish and fresh fish.
<p>
Life in Chinatown is in full swing around the clock and, oddly enough, this area is considered one of the safest in all of New York. You definitely have to come here to feel fully that America is a country of immigrants from all over the world.</p>
